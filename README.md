# Kata Binary Tree

This is a play ground to experiment with trees (not only binary) in Java. 

## Invert a binary tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Example 1:

![alt text](./img/invert1-tree.jpg "Invert tree example one")

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

### Example 2:

![alt text](./img/invert2-tree.jpg "Invert tree example two")

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]

### Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
